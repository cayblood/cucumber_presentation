<h2>Training</h2>
<p>David and Gojko run public and on-site training workshops for aspiring Cucumber teams. Our workshops are designed for business users, analysts, testers and developers. Through facilitated exercises and discussion, these workshops provide teams with practical experience of agile acceptance testing, behaviour-driven development and specification by example. The participants learn how to collaborate on specifications and tests, how to design good Cucumber tests and how to automate them efficiently.

<p>On-site workshops are typically customised to fit the business domains and particular needs of teams, so that the participants get real-world experience and instant benefits.</p>
<p>More than 90% of previous attendees said that the workshops improved their performance at work.</p>
