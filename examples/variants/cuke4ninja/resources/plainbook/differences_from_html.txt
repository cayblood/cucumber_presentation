Differences from HTML:

1. Web links are <url link="http://www.google.com" />. They can have a title (<url link="http://www.google.com" title="Google" />) in which case the link is automatically rendered as a footnote.

2. Internal links between document parts are defined with <link ref="element_id" />. element_id should point to the ID of a section, figure, chapter or any other thing that can have an ID. the title and page number will automatically be inserted

3. sections can be defined with <section title="Section title" id="section_id"> ... </section>. You can embed sections into other sections

4. images can be defined with <img src="filename" title="image title" id="image_id" />. image file name is relative to the images folder

5. code sections can be defined with <code src="filename" /> or <code> ... </code>. they are rendered with a monspace font. file name is relative to the resources/src folder (built with rebuildcode.sh from src). optional part attribute can pull out just a part of the source file based on the comments (start the part with //START:part_name and end it with //END:part_name. 

6. <todo> comment </todo> is a way to leave comments 

7. use &ldquo; and &rdquo; instead of double quotes, &lsquo; and &rsquo; instead of single quotes

8. You can use special sections <sidebar title="" > for sidebars, <note title="..."> for notes, <warning title="..."> for warnings. these cannot have embedded sections but can be embedded anywhere in sections

9. Images might be rendered on the next page etc so instead of "below" or "above", refer to them in the text with <link ref="..." />
