This project is not a test project for SpecFlow, but a sample specflow test 
project that is used for testing the reporting.

The unit tests generated by SpecFlow are disabled, to avoid execution and 
fake error reports for SpecFlow.

Enable the sample tests:
- set the "Custom Tool" property of the feature file nodes to "SpecFlowSingleFileGenerator"

Disable the sample tests:
- set the "Custom Tool" property of the feature file nodes to empty
