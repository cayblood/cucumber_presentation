Feature: Feature with successful scenarios
	In order to test reporting
	As a SpecFlow developer
	I want to have a feature that has successful scenarios

Scenario: First successful scenario
	Given I have a precondition that is successful
	When I do something that works
	Then I have a postcondition that is successful

Scenario: Second successful scenario
	Given I have a precondition that is successful
	And I have a precondition that is successful
	When I do something that works
	Then I have a postcondition that is successful
